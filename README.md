Car Service system is a software created for digitalization and acceleration of car repair service. The software provides the functions of a complete workflow: adding, updating and deleting a customer account, spare parts and appointments; calculating cost, making payments and creating an annual report.

Creating a client account requires client to provide contact information. Once the account is created, the manager can use the client's last name to realise most of the software functions.
